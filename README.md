# Bookmark_manager

## Domain Modelling

In order to begin behaviour driven development, we created the following user story:

```
As a user
So that I can visit my favourite sites
I'd like to see a list of bookmarks
```

Below is our first domain model in order to start driving the development of the classes.

After browsing the walkthrough we have also added a process model.
